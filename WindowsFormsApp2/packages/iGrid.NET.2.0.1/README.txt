This NuGet package provides a starter sample demonstrating how to populate 10Tec iGrid.NET WinForms grid control.

Change the startup form of the project to FormStarterSample to see iGrid.NET in action. If you are using Visual Basic, open the project properties, select the Application tab, and choose FormStarterSample in the Startup Form drop-down list. If you are using C#, open the Program.cs file and change the Application.Run() call as follows:

Application.Run(new SamplesCS.FormStarterSample());

The full design-time functionality for iGrid.NET is not available because of the limitations related to the control redistribution based on NuGet packages. To enable the design-time functionality and see other richer samples of iGrid usage, download and install the full iGrid demo from the 10Tec Company website:
